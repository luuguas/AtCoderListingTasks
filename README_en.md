First, select [All] or [Specify the range]. When you choose [Specify the range], you can set the range of problems you want to open by clicking on the drop-downs on the right. The limit of the number of problems that you can open at once is 20.

Also, if you check [Open in reverse order] checkbox, the problems will be open in reverse order.

Then, you can open all selected problems by clicking [Open at once] button in the lower right corner.

However, if pop-ups are blocked in your browser settings, the problems will not open even if you click the button. In that case, please change your browser settings and allow pop-ups.

(In Chrome, when pop-ups are blocked, an icon will appear in the address bar. you can allow pop-ups by clicking on it and selecting "Always allow.")
